# Project-Landing-Page
Iâ€™ll be creating an entire web page from a design provided to me.
Introduction:
In this project, I will build a complete web page based on a design provided in the form of two images. The first image shows the full website layout, and the second provides details about the fonts and colors used.

Project Overview
Design: The design includes 2 images:

Image One: Full design of the website.
Image Two: Details about the fonts and colors.
Objective: The goal is to replicate the design as closely as possible without worrying about pixel-perfect precision. The focus is on positioning elements correctly and ensuring the overall structure resembles the provided design.

Customization: I am free to substitute my own content into the design. The placeholder content can be replaced with real text and images, and I can experiment with different colors and fonts.

Getting Started
Setup:

I will begin by setting up a Git repository for the project. This repository will act as a portfolio moving forward, so I will ensure that everything is documented and stored correctly.
HTML & CSS:

The project will be developed section by section, starting with the HTML to place all the content on the page, followed by CSS to style it. Only one CSS file will be used for simplicity.
Design Elements:

Font: The design uses the Roboto font.
Hero Text: The main statement at the top of the page.
Flexbox:

I will utilize Flexbox for layout management, drawing from previous exercises if needed.
Notes on Images
I will ensure that any images used are free for public use and properly credited in this README file. Sources such as Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash will be utilized for free-to-use images.
Repository Management
Commits: I will commit early and often throughout the project, following best practices for commit messages.
GitHub: The final project will be pushed to GitHub as part of my portfolio.
Credits
Image Credits: Any images used will be credited here with the creator's name and source link.
